# AGI-SOC

📌 Overview

The AGI Cyber Security SOC Project is an AI-driven Security Operations Center (SOC) platform designed to automate threat detection, incident response, and security intelligence using Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) principles.

Unlike traditional SIEM/SOC tools that rely heavily on rule-based detection and human intervention, this platform focuses on:

Autonomous threat analysis

Adaptive learning

Real-time response orchestration

Human-in-the-loop decision support

The goal is to reduce alert fatigue, accelerate response times, and enable self-improving cyber defense systems.

🎯 Key Objectives

Automate SOC workflows using AI/AGI reasoning

Detect known, unknown, and zero-day threats

Correlate security events across multiple data sources

Provide actionable intelligence, not just alerts

Support enterprise, government, and critical-infrastructure use cases
